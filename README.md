Make sure you make a PR to your own repo's main and not the class' repo!! Otherwise you will lose points!!
Still made a PR on the wrong repo once by accident (delete it right away). The PR notification pop out on my repo but the direction for PR is defult to be the class repo and I didn't change it. Now I understand even if it pop out on my repo doesn't guaranteed that's a PR to my repo.

## question in explore
### 1.
No, I would not use a unit test to test the “message”. The message function interact with many other functions between the frontend, backend, and possibly a database or network. Unit tests are meant for small, isolated functions.

### 2. 
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature. This is a clear and simple logic that can be implemented in a single function, so it's suit for unit testing. We can easily check whether messages of different lengths are accepted or rejected.
