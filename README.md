## question in explore
### 1.
No, I would not use a unit test to test the “message”. The message function interact with many other functions between the frontend, backend, and possibly a database or network. Unit tests are meant for small, isolated functions.

### 2. 
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature. This is a clear and simple logic that can be implemented in a single function, so it's suit for unit testing. We can easily check whether messages of different lengths are accepted or rejected.
